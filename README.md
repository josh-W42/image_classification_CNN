# CNN Image Classification with Pytorch.

### Description:

Here are the notes from a image classification course I was taking at the time. It's all contained in the notebook.

The assets, like the training and validation photo datasets, are not included since they were rather large.

### Scope:

The goal was to train a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify images of flowers and identify their planet species.

After training, you could supply a photo of a flower and the model would return approximations on what flower species it was.

These approximations would be displayed on a bar plot like bellow.

### Background:

A while back (in 2019) I was diving into machine learning and deep learning topics.

However, until recently I couldn't find any records of the work I was doing around the time.

(Some work was saved on different computers, some work I felt too embarrassed to put on github etc...)

These topics were all new to me, and intimidating, but I want to revisit these in the future because they were fascinating.
